    "| Package | Role in the System | Why You Need It |\n",
    "|:---|:---|:---|\n",
    "| **`jupyterlab`** (or `notebook`) | **The Server/Interface:** This is the application that launches the web browser interface, manages files, and hosts the entire notebook environment. | You need this to **start** Jupyter (e.g., `$ jupyter lab`). It's the front end. |\n",
    "| **`ipykernel`** | **The Connector/Bridge:** This package tells the `jupyterlab` server *where* to find and *how* to talk to the specific Python executable inside your `.venv`. | You need this to register your custom **`uv`** environment as an available **Kernel** for running code. |\n",
    "| **`yfinance`**, etc. | **The Libraries:** The actual packages that execute your data analysis code. | You need this to run your cell code without a `ModuleNotFoundError`. |\n",

    "| **Core Input** | Python Code (cells) and DataFrames. | Text-based Sources (PDFs, Google Docs, uploaded files) – up to 50 sources. |\n",
    "| **Output** | Executable code, data visualizations, and text output generated by your code. | Summaries, timelines, Q\\&A with citations, conceptual connections, and AI-generated study guides based on your sources. |\n",
    "| **AI Integration** | Not built-in. Requires manually installing the `google-genai` library and calling the API. | **Built-in**. Uses Gemini models internally to analyze the text sources you provide. |\n",
    "| **Best Use Case** | **Developing** the TA strategy code, debugging functions, **visualizing** the backtest results. | **Researching** security standards (e.g., OWASP, CIS), summarizing academic papers on risk analysis, or preparing for DevSecOps interviews based on your uploaded documentation. |\n",
